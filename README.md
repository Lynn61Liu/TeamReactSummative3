#### Project scenarios
ZIP  ( Zero Invasive Predators Ltd) was established in February 2015 as a research and development entity focused on developing the tools and techniques to enable an ambitious and exciting vision for New Zealand:  The complete removal of rats, stoats, and possums from large mainland areas for the long term, sustainable protection of native biodiversity.

To help communities engage with this vision ZIP would like to develop an app that enables users to photograph wildlife in their area and receives feedback from community member. Images and feedback are intended to be publicly available on a web site and displayed in an engaging way on screens at the ZIP offices.
