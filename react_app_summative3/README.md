## MERN Stack

The research was done about the advantages of using MERN stack for developing our app. The MERN stack is a JavaScript stack that includes 4 components: MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.

### `1. MongoDB`

MongoDB is a cross-platform document database which is schema-less (we can store our data in documents written in a JSON-based query language). Data is stored in flexible documents with a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)-based query language. The content, size, and number of fields in the documents can differ from one to the next. This means that the data structure to be changed over time. MongoDB is flexible and easy to scale.

### `2. Express`

Express is a Node.js web application framework. It is fast, minimal and flexible framework which was used to save from writing full web server code by hand. The Express framework is designed for building robust web applications and APIs. Many popular frameworks are based on Express.

### `3. React`

React is JavaScript front-end library for building user interfaces. React has component-based approach which let us maintain and render components on its own and offers the reusability of the code. It makes app development faster and easier. The library is capable to run on servers, it gives the ability to run the same code on the browser as well as the server.

### `4. Node.js`

Node.js is a platform built on Chromeâ€™s JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications. Node.js brings JavaScript to the server. It can execute JavaScript code outside of a browser.
